# Java-Spring
Getting Started with Java Spring


## Spring Framework 

- Framework for providing comprehensive infrastructual support for developig java apps 


- Easy to start building apps.Focus on the business logiic. 

- Spring supports strong oop practice. 


## Java Definition 

- POJO Object. Plain Old Java Object. There are some rules to creating a POJO object in java 


1- Class must be public. 

2- Props must be private

3- this class must have a public default constructor. 

4- can have an optioinal argument constructor

5- Every prop should have a a getter and a setter. 



- JavaBeans  - Sim-pe object with only getters and setters

- SpringBeans  - POJOs configured in the application context. 

- DTO - Bean used to move state between layers. 


### Inversion of Control (IoC)

- This is the pattern that is being used in Spring. 

- ioC container provides mechanism of dependency injection. 

- Application Context wraps the BeanFactorty, which serves the beans to the runtime of the application. 


- Spring Boot provides auto-configuration of the ApplicationContext. 


## Why Spring Boot.
