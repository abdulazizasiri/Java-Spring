### Web Service and APIs

Web services, APIs, and microservices

- Web services are designed to communicate with other services, or programs. 


###  Web services and API overview

A web service is a way to share data between two disparate systems. The communication typically happens between a client and a server.


Client - The client makes a request for data.
Server - The server responds to the client's request.


The means of communication between the client and server is via a standard web protocol like HTTP (or HTTPS) on the world wide web, that uses a common language like JSON or XML.

A client invokes a web service by sending an XML (or JSON) message, then waits for a corresponding XML response from the server.
