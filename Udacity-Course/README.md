### Spring Framework 

Java web development with Spring Boot 


There  are three main components in a web application


1- Data Storage -> How the data is stored
 
2- Application Logic -> What kind od service provide the logic for your application 

3- Client Access  ->  What kind of client access your services 


### Spring 

Spring is a framework that encompasses many useful Java libraries for web development. Spring includes numerous essential web development "components", such as database access, security, cloud deployment, web services, and many more.


### Spring Boot 

Spring Boot is a part of the Spring framework, which helps in rapid application development. Spring Boot helps to develop stand-alone and enterprise web applications. The advantage of using Spring Boot is that developers can get started with Spring's core libraries with a minimum configuration setup. Therefore, Spring Boot helps to speed up application development.

### Spring versus Spring Boot

Spring versus Spring Boot
Both Spring and Spring Boot frameworks help to build microservices-based web applications. Internally, the Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring framework. In general, the Spring (core module) takes care of the actions, such as:

1- Inversion of Control (IoC)

2- Dependency injection

3- Common annotations

4- Implements and provides the foundation for other frameworks, such as Thymeleaf, MyBatis, Spring MVC, and many others.

Whereas, Spring Boot brings all the functionality of Spring and some additional advantages, such as:

1- It can automatically configure Spring and third-party libraries

2- It provides necessary dependencies to ease the build configuration


This way, Spring Boot helps to speed up application development. It is a matter of software requirements to choose between Spring and Spring Boot frameworks. Either of the frameworks can be used to build microservices-based web applications. However, Spring Boot helps to get things done faster.


### Where Spring boot shines? 

Spring boot shines when you want to do the following:


1- If your project aims to connect simultaneous users on different clients, you probably need to build a server, which Spring Boot can help with.


2-
